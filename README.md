# Objective: 
This purpose of this project is just to familiarise myself with react native.

# What I learned from this project: 
* Custom UI Component
* Formik
* Yup
* Global stylesheet
* Working with image in React Native
* Navigation ( Stack navigation and Drawer navigation and combining both of them )

# Retrospective

Initially I thought Expo is super awesome, being able to scan a QR code and run the project on my own device seemlessly with hot reload seems awesome. But sadly it does not perform as well as I initially thought. The compilation process often crashes and there's a weird issue with Expo I ran into when I running it on the Expo application from Google Play. such as: 
* Glitchy header, the header overlap with my device's notification bar ( that bar that shows battery persentage and notification from local application and the last character of header title turns into ellipsis.( High key triggered me ü§¨ )
* Gimmicks, just like other technology Expo comes with their weird traits that we developer have to learn and work around. such as: close down modal before triggering the hot reload and restart expo after installing a new package... etc. 

I definitely can see why some people really does not like React Native, but I genuinely enjoyed working with React Native. It allows a developer with a working knowledge of React to develop a mobile application with a very little learning curve, there are just to many shared concept from React in React Native.
